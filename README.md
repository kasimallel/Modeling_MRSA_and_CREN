Overview

This repository contains the files and scripts associated with our study on the cost-effectiveness of screening, decolonisation, and isolation strategies for Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in hospitals. The study utilizes a sex-stratified mathematical modelling approach to analyze these strategies.
